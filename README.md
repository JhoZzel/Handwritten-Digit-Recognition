In the present project, we have developed a digit classification system using machine learning techniques. Our application includes two main components: a data collection tool for capturing handwritten digits and a classifier that predicts the digits based on input images.

### Project Components

- **Data Collection**: This part of the project consists of an interactive interface that allows users to draw digits directly on a digital canvas. This data is used to train and improve the classification model.

- **Digit Classifier**: Using a pre-trained machine learning model, our application can predict the digit corresponding to an input image. The model is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and has been trained on a dataset of handwritten digits.

### Model Training

The training of the model has been carried out using a Google Colab collaborative environment. The code and training details are available at the following link:

This link allows access to the Colab notebook where the code used to train and evaluate the digit classification model is located. The trained model has subsequently been used in the digit sorting application developed as part of this project.
